# Autonomous Vehicle Navigation System

## Overview
A decentralized AI-powered navigation system built on the Stacks blockchain, enabling autonomous vehicles to navigate complex routes safely and efficiently.

## Smart Contracts

### 1. Vehicle Registry Contract (vehicle-registry.clar)
- Manages vehicle registration and authentication
- Stores vehicle credentials and permissions
- Handles ownership transfers and access control

### 2. Route Validation Contract (route-validation.clar)
- Validates proposed navigation routes
- Implements safety checks and collision avoidance rules
- Manages route optimization parameters

### 3. Autonomous Navigation Contract (autonomous-nav.clar)
- Core navigation logic and AI integration
- Handles real-time route updates and emergency protocols
- Manages navigation state and vehicle coordination

## Development Setup

1. Install Dependencies:
```bash
npm install -g @stacks/cli
npm install -g clarinet
```

2. Initialize Project:
```bash
clarinet new autonomous-vehicle-nav
cd autonomous-vehicle-nav
```

3. Run Tests:
```bash
clarinet test
```

## Security Considerations
- Input validation for all route parameters
- Access control for vehicle registration
- Secure state management
- Rate limiting for route updates
- Emergency stop mechanisms

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each contract function
- Integration tests for multi-contract interactions
- Property-based testing for route validation
- Minimum 50% test coverage requirement
- Continuous Integration setup
